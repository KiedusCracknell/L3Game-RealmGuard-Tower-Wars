##relevent implications
- ethical
  I adressed both the legal and ethical relevent implications by crediting resources I used to make my game, such as the assets I used in the game. 
  Crediting the creators of assets is ethical because it shows respect to the original cretor of the resources, it provides transparancy to users 
  of my game allowing them to explore the work of the asset creators if they wish, and crediting the creator is just a social norm.
